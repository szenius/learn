# Where do I begin?

I know many friends who are looking to get started with programming, but don't exactly know where to start. While there are a lot of resources available online for this purpose, it might be initimidating and overwhelming just how much resources there are out there. So I've decided to start this little Markdown page to share any resources I may find useful. Hopefully it serves as a good starting point for anyone out there who is just trying to learn.

I'll be updating this page progressively, so do keep it in your bookmarks! You can also write a comment if you have a request for any particular content, or if you have a useful resource to share.
